<div class="wikidoc">Simply run the MouseJiggle.exe included in the release .zip file.  Check the &quot;Enable jiggle?&quot; checkbox to start jiggling the mouse pointer; uncheck it to stop.  The jiggle is slight enough that you should be able to use the computer normally even with jiggling enabled.<br /><br />The &#39;Zen jiggle?&#39; checkbox enables a mode in which the pointer is jiggled &#39;virtually&#39; - the system believes it to be moving and thus screen saver activation, etc., is prevented, but the pointer does not actually move.<br /><br />To minimize Mouse Jiggler to the system tray, click the button marked with a green, down-pointing arrow.<br /><br />If you want to start the Mouse Jiggler with jiggling already enabled, run the MouseJiggle.exe with either the <b>-j</b> or <b>--jiggle</b> command-line switch.<br /><br />The &quot;-z&quot; / &quot;--zen&quot; command-line switch forces zen jiggling to be enabled for the current (and future) invocations of MouseJiggler.<br /><br />(Added in 1.5+): The &quot;-m&quot; / &quot;--minimized&quot; command-like switch tells MouseJiggler to start already minimized.<br /><br />That&#39;s it.  Enjoy!</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
